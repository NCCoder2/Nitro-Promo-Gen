# Nitro Promo Generator
The Nitro Promo Generator generated nitro promotion links providing 1 month free nitro using python. The generator abuses the same API Opera uses to generate the promotions. This also includes a proxy checker that will check the proxies listed in proxies.txt, and will use the valid proxies to spam the api for promotion links.
